# ⚡ FREq: Your Personal Music Frequency

> "Stop sharing links. Start sharing a vibe."

## 🚀 The Vision
FREq is not just another music player. It's a **synchronized social experience**. It allows DJs, curators, and friends to create their own "Frequency"—a persistent live stream where anyone can tune in, chat, and react in perfect real-time sync.

## ✨ Why FREq?

### 1. Zero-Friction Social Listening
No logins required for listeners. Just share your URL (e.g., `freq.fm/f/night-vibes`) and anyone who clicks it is immediately synced to the beat.

### 2. DJ-First Experience
Integrated tools for DJs to manage history, pin tracks, and build a following. As a DJ, you own your handle and your audience.

### 3. Immersive Aesthetics
*   **Real-time Visualizer**: Reactive elements that dance to the music.
*   **Sync-Glow Architecture**: High-energy peaks trigger visual "glitch" effects across the platform for a premium club feel.
*   **Floating Reactions**: Real-time emoji bursts that let the crowd feel the energy without breaking the chat flow.

### 4. Technical Excellence
*   **Micro-Sync Engine**: Low-latency WebSocket synchronization ensures every listener is heard at the exact same millisecond.
*   **Vercel Optimized**: Scalable, global delivery of the frontend with a robust Node.js backend.
*   **Zero Dependencies**: Built with vanilla JS for blazing fast performance and no framework bloat.

## 📈 The Roadmap
*   [ ] **Cross-Platform Integration**: Spotify & SoundCloud support.
*   [ ] **Tokenized Tipping**: Support your favorite DJs directly on the platform.
*   [ ] **Private Frequencies**: Password-protected rooms for intimate listen-alongs.

## 🚢 Deploying to Vercel
FREq is built to be cloud-native.
1.  **Static Speed**: Vercel serves our glassmorphism UI from the edge.
2.  **API Routing**: Serverless functions handle discovery and stats.
3.  **Deployment**: One-click deployment with the included `vercel.json`.
